                    8. Your Rights to Your Information
                    1. In accordance with effective regulations You have a significant number of rights related to
                    your Personal Information, such as e.g.:
                    1. The right to access and amend the personal information we hold about you. You have
                    a right to request a copy of the personal information we hold about you. Also you have the right to
                    correct or update your Personal Information at any time.
                    2. The right to delete the Personal Information. You may request to remove the personal
                    data if you do not want to use our Services or want your data to be erased, you can request us to
                    remove your account permanently. Should that be a case, your requests could be fulfilled by the
                    erasure of personal data to the extent permissible by the applicable law and regulations. In certain
                    cases we are obliged to store your information to be legally compliant.
                    3. The right to restrict processing. You have the right to ask us to restrict the processing
                    of your Personal Information. When processing is restricted, we can still store your information, but

                    4. The right to object to the processing of your data. You have a right to object to our
                    use of your Personal Information for our own purpose at any time. In other words you can withdraw
                    your consent to processing your Personal Information by us. In case you want to exercise this right,
                    you may contact us. This right also includes the right to object to processing your Personal
                    Information for marketing and advertising purposes. You can do it by clicking on the special button (an
                    unsubscribe button) or by contact us and opting out from receiving all e-mails.
                    5. The right to data portability. You have the right to receive Personal Information you

                    3. There are exceptions to these rights, however. For example, access to Personal Information
                    may be denied in some circumstances if making the information available would reveal Personal
                    Information about another person or if we are legally prevented from disclosing such information. In
                    addition, where some of the data is necessary to maintain our Website and Services or where that is
                    a legal requirement, we may retain such data for the period it is needed or required even if you
                    withdraw your consent or cancel your account. Such information will not be considered as subject to
                    erasure.<br/><br/>
                    9. Law and Harm
                    1. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your
                    information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal
                    process, or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or
                    technical issues; or to protect our or our users’ rights or property. However, nothing in this Policy is
                    intended to limit any legal defences or objections that you may have to a government’s request for
                    disclosure of your information.<br/><br/>
